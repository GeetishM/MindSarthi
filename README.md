## 🧪 How to Run Locally

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
https://github.com/TeamCtrlFreaks/MindSarthi

# 2. Install Flutter packages
dart pub get

# 3. Run the app
flutter run
```

### 🔐 Firebase Setup

Ensure you link your Firebase project with:
- Authentication (Email/Password)
- Firestore (with rules for role-based users)
- Firestore Collections: users, sessions, moods

---

## 🛡️ Security & Environment Configuration

Sensitive keys and configuration files have been intentionally **excluded from version control** using `.gitignore` to ensure security and portability.

### 🔒 Ignored Files:

- `lib/firebase_options.dart` – Auto-generated Firebase config (use `flutterfire configure` to regenerate)
- `lib/services/gemini_api_key.dart` – Gemini API Key (replace with your own securely)

These files are excluded via `.gitignore` to **protect API keys** and prevent accidental exposure. If you're running the project locally, make sure to:
- Set up your Firebase project and regenerate `firebase_options.dart`
- Add your Gemini API key in the appropriate file

> ✅ *Do not commit secrets or credentials to the repo. Use `.env`, `flutter_dotenv`, or secure key management for production.*
